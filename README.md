# Movies Project

In this project I collected data from my Letterboxd account in order to analyze my movie rating history from 2020 until march 2023, with the goal of **understanding what makes me enjoy a movie**. 

I downloaded a dataset related to my personal account from Letterbox with the columns: Date, Name, Year, Rating.
However, the data was not enough to get good insights from it so I used other data sets in order to obtain information such as movie genre, director, public rating and budget.
